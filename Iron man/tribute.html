                        <h2 class="list-heading">He created a game called Blastar</h2>
                        <p class="pgh">Elon Musk taught himself how to code at the age of 12. As he did that, he created a game called Blastar. On top of that, he sold the source code to the PC and Office Technology magazine for $500.<br><br>The interesting thing is that you can still play the game today. It shows that even from a young age, Musk was an innovator and he really wanted to do something different.

                        <h2 class="list-heading">Musk and his brother started the company Zip2 in 1995</h2>
                        <p class="pgh">This was their first venture and it was designed to create online city guide software to newspapers. The company managed to grow quite a bit, and Compaq eventually paid $300 million for it in 1999, with Musk getting $22 million from the entire sale.<br><br>That was a great starting point for him to fund new businesses and come up with new creative ideas on his own.

                        <h2 class="list-heading">Elon was an inspiration for Tony Stark in Marvel’s Iron Man movies</h2>
                        <p class="pgh">Robert Downey Jr has a lot of charisma and his presence in the movies oozes charm and exciting ideas. The great thing to note here is that portrayal was inspired by Elon Musk, who was all those things in real-life at that time.<br><br>It was an exciting thing to see, and it brought in a lot of interesting ways for the character to grow and evolve. A lot of people believed it was all Downey’s character and charisma, but it seems they did want to pay a tribute to Musk too.

                        <h2 class="list-heading">When he came to the US, Musk lived on $1 per day</h2>
                        <p class="pgh">Yes, it might sound crazy, but when his family came to the US, he had a budget of $1 per day. The only way that he survived was by buying food in bulk. Even today, Elon Musk is making a very low amount of money as the Tesla CEO.<br><br>So even if he might be quite rich stock-wise, he is trying to live a frugal life. His focus is on creativity and success, not on richness.
